[PROJECT] Pythagorean Triples Checker
BACKGROUND INFORMATION

A Pythagorean triple consists of three positive integers a, b, and c, such that a2 + b2 = c2. Such a triple is commonly written (a, b, c), and a well-known example is (3, 4, 5). If (a, b, c) is a Pythagorean triple, then so is (ka, kb, kc) for any positive integer k. A primitive Pythagorean triple is one in which a, b and c are coprime (that is, they have no common divisor larger than 1).[1] A triangle whose sides form a Pythagorean triple is called a Pythagorean triangle, and is necessarily a right triangle.

The name is derived from the Pythagorean theorem, stating that every right triangle has side lengths satisfying the formula a2 + b2 = c2; thus, Pythagorean triples describe the three integer side lengths of a right triangle. However, right triangles with non-integer sides do not form Pythagorean triples. For instance, the triangle with sides a = b = 1 and c = √2 is a right triangle, but (1, 1, √2) is not a Pythagorean triple because √2 is not an integer. Moreover, 1 and √2 do not have an integer common multiple because √2 is irrational.

MAIN GOAL

Create a program that allows the user to input the sides of any triangle, and then return whether the triangle is a Pythagorean Triple or not.

SUBGOALS

If your program requires users to input the sides in a specific order, change the coding so the user can type in the sides in any order. Remember, the hypotenuse (c) is always the longest side.

Loop the program so the user can use it more than once without having to restart the program.
